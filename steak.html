            <li>(Optional) If you decide to add mustard, put it in the glassware like the olive oil too.</li>
            <li>Take the steak and put it in the Pyrex so it can be mixed with the olive oil and mustard on both sides.</li>

        <h2>Tips!</h2>

        <li><strong>You should sprinkle on both sides of the steak for better taste!</strong></li>
        <li><strong>When you take the steak out of the oven to turn it around, you can slice it a little bit with a knife, to get cooked better on the insides.</strong></li>
